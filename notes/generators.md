# Generators

[python code](../src/generators.py)

A *generator* of a group, `G`, is an element, `g`, such that the subgroup generated by `g` is equal to `G`. In other words,

```
[x] := residue of x in Zn
<g> := { [g^k] : 0 <= k /\ k < n }
```

`<g> = G`, not only are the groups isomorphic, they also contain the same elements.
