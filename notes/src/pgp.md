## OpenPGP

In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP. They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard.

The Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP-compliant software suite called *GNU Privacy Guard*.

## GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)
